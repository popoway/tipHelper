- [x] basic calculation
- [x] responsive `tipSegmentedControl`
- [x] tap blank to close keyboard
- [x] share `total` result
- [x] basic logical error check
- [ ] check for extraneous dots
- [ ] adapt to new iPhones
- [ ] toggle tax / change tax rate
- [ ] bottom buttons attached to keyboard
- [ ] save settings: local storage
